# 🧑‍💻 Data Structures and Algorithms Practice Log
I'll log the various data structures and algorithms that I'm practising to enhance my knowledge and understanding.
I'll also be using it as a log to track my progress and the amount of time I have spent.

## Format 
The codes are mostly written in python language.
Each consists of :
1. Problem Statment
2. Solution(s) code
3. Space and Time Complexity Analysis

## ✍️ My Journey
Daily Progress log and which topic the problems belong to
